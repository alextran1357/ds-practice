## 🔍 Topics Covered

| 📁 Topic | 💡 Description |
|---------|----------------|
| `01-linear-regression` | Explore relationships between continuous variables using linear regression. Includes residual analysis and regularization techniques. |
| `02-logistic-regression` | Binary classification using logistic regression. ROC curves, AUC, and model evaluation. |
| `03-k-nearest-neighbors` | Classification and regression using KNN. Includes hyperparameter tuning. |
| `04-decision-trees` | Tree-based models with pruning, feature importance, and overfitting analysis. |
| `05-cross-validation` | Implement k-fold CV, LOOCV, and train-test splits with performance comparisons. |
| `06-unsupervised-learning` | PCA, clustering (KMeans, hierarchical), and visual exploration of high-dimensional data. |
| `07-model-evaluation` | Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. |
